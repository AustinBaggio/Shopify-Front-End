## Brief Overview 
The css and js folder holds a local copy of the Bootstrap style sheets and linking files. 
The index.html file holds the HTML, and it follows the Bootstrap grid structure. 
The script.js file holds the validation code that is used to check the user inputs. 

A local build would work by simply opening the index.html file in a browser
